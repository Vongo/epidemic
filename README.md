# epidemic
Yet another simulator for epidemics and civil response.

The simulator logic entirely belongs to [Christophe Genolini](https://gitlab.com/ChristopheGen/simucovid19/-/tree/master).
Key concepts are given in the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDG6dm9bSyw) (in French).

This repository is dedicated to bringing an easy-to-use UI on top of it, thanks to R and [Shiny](shiny.rstudio.com/).

The result can be seen [HERE](https://vongo.shinyapps.io/epidemic/).
